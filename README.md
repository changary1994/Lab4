# **[Wild Pokemon Encounter](https://wildpokemonencounter.herokuapp.com/)**

## General Information:

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/changary1994/Lab4)

This app was created using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a dynamic web page. The API used was from the Pokemon Company, found [here](https://pokeapi.co/). The code was validated using https://validator.w3.org/nu/about.html for both CSS and HTML. The app fetches the data from the API and generates a new Pokemon every second, and takes the name data and sprite data from the API, and displays it to the web page.

## How to Run:

Simply click the link at the top to run the file, or download the file contents and open the HTML file on your browser.

## Future Improvements: 

The app will include a button to manualize the spawns, as well as a chance for rarer "shiny Pokemon" encounters to appear at a 1 in 4096 chance with each press.
